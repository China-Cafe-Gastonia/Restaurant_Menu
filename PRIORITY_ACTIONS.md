## üîç How to Track Progress

Create a GitHub Project board with columns:
- **Backlog** - All tasks from this document
- **In Progress** - Currently working on
- **Testing** - Implemented, needs verification
- **Done** - Completed and tested

Or use a simple markdown checklist (this file!).

## üö® Breaking Changes Warning

When implementing these changes, some features may temporarily break:

### Safe Order to Make Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Create new files first (don't delete old code yet)
2. ‚úÖ Import new modules alongside old code
3. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly
4. ‚úÖ Only then remove old code
5. ‚úÖ Commit after each working change

### Rollback Plan:
- Keep backups in `backup/` folder
- Use Git branches for major changes
- Test in a staging environment first (GitHub Pages preview)

## üí¨ Questions or Need Help?

If you get stuck on any of these tasks:
1. Check the detailed CODE_REVIEW.md document
2. Consult Firebase documentation
3. Test changes incrementally
4. Ask for help with specific error messages

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of done. Start with Priority 1 items and iterate!
